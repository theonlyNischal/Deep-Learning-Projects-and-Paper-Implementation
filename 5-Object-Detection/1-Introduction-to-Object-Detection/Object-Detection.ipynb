    "Classical and Modern CNNs were responsible to extract features from image and classify them into category. In image classification there is only one output(class of the image) and we only focus on how to find the class. There are many cases where there are multiple objects with different categories. Object detection is a process of classifying each objects and finding position of each object in the given image. \n",
